//! _squadleader_ is a crate containing a type system and a rule engine that is

//!
//! Further, this crate is not supposed to be a game. However, it can probably
//! be used as a starting point, create one.
//! The purpose of this crate is to model types and rules of the original game.
//! You can think of it as a type system and rule engine modeling the game
//! of chess, without being an actual playable chess game.
//!
//! References to the original 4th Edition Squad Leader rules are made
//! in the source, and expressed in the following manner:
//! `SLX.Y` refers to paragraph X.Y in the original 4th ed. rule book.
//! All rules, that do not reference the original game, are labled RX.Y.
