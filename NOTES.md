squadleader (sl) is a type system and rule engine that can be used as a starting point
when modeling and simulating small unit infantry combat. The type system and rules are
based on a classic board game with the same name.

Q: if a unit is told to move across the map, is that unit moving for just the turn that the command is issued? or is it moving each turn until it reaches it's destination?

Q: what does it mean to "have moved" in a turn?

Q: how are turns determined? is there a fixed update loop that increments a turn count?
